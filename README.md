# Java Number Parity Analyzer – Internship Task 3

A structured and well-documented Java console application that determines whether a number is **Even** or **Odd** using multiple programming approaches.

This project was completed as part of my Java Internship to demonstrate strong understanding of decision-making logic, operators, debugging, and advanced Java features.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To determine whether a given integer is Even or Odd using:

- Modulo Operator (%)
- Ternary Operator
- Bitwise AND Operator
- Recursive Method
- Lambda Expression (Java 8+)
- Input Validation

---

## 🛠️ Features

✔ Static number evaluation  
✔ User input using `Scanner`  
✔ Modular method implementation  
✔ Ternary operator for concise decision-making  
✔ Bitwise approach for optimized checking  
✔ Recursive parity checking  
✔ Lambda expression implementation (Java 8)  
✔ Input validation for non-integer values  
✔ Debugging exercise demonstration

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used

- Modulo Operator (`%`)
- Conditional Execution
- Ternary Operator (`? :`)
- Bitwise AND (`&`)
- Recursion
- Lambda Expressions
- Input Validation
- Debugging and Error Handling

## 🔍 Debugging Exercise Included

The project demonstrates common mistakes and their corrections:

- Type mismatch errors
- Assignment vs comparison errors
- Integer handling issues
- Proper use of equality operator (`==`)

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

- UI State toggling (even/odd click logic)
- Alternating row styling (zebra striping)
- Parity bit checking in error detection
- Cryptographic logic foundations
- Hash distribution algorithms

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I improved my understanding of:

- Logical decision-making in Java
- Clean and readable coding practices
- Mathematical implementation in programming
- Structured documentation
- Advanced Java 8 features
- 
## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Support batch processing for multiple numbers
- Implement unit testing using JUnit
- Convert to REST API version
